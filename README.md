PhoediX is a non destructive image editing application created by Jacob Chesley.

The current list of image edits PhoediX is capable of are:

* **Brightness Adjustment** Adjust the brightness of the image with options to preserve details in shadows, highlights, or both.
* **Contrast Adjustment** Adjust the contrast using a linear or built in S curve function, to give the image a more vivid or flat look.
* **Adjust HSL** Adjust the Hue, Saturtation, and Luminance (HSL) channels of the image.
* **Adjust LAB** Adjust the Luminance, A, and B (LAB) channels of the image.
* **Adjust RGB** Adjust the Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) channels of the image.
* **HSL Curves** Adjust the Hue, Saturtation, and Luminance (HSL) channels of the image using custom defined curves.
* **LAB Curves** Adjust the Luminance, A, and B (LAB) channels of the image using custom defined curves.
* **RGB Curves** Adjust the Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) channels of the image using custom defined curves.
* **Grayscale Conversion** Convert the image to greyscale, with three different options. Options include Average of RGB channels, human eyesight scale, or custom scale.
* **Channel Mixer** Mix RGB master channels of the image with RGB subchannels for each channel.
* **Rotate Image** 	Rotate the image 90, 180, or 270 degrees. Custom angles and cropping available as well, using nearest neighbor, bilinear, or bicubic interpolation.
* **Mirror Image** 	Mirror the image vertically or horizontally.
* **Scale Image** Scale and resize the image to any size (with or without preserving the aspect ratio).  Choose nearest neighbor, bilinear, or bicubic interpolation.
